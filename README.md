# Boat rental website

![Screenshot of the website](/assets/srbaatutleie_screenshot.png)

This website is about boat rental. Above are two links that lead to the wishlist and menu. The website has active text that changes at intervals and 3 slideshows that lead to websites with a detailed description of the characteristics. All boats can be added and removed from the wishlist. At the bottom of the website are links that lead to pages on social networks.

In addition i took idea with the animated menu button from the Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=%2Fvlt_dev%2F&source=omni_redirect
