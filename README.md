This website is about boat rental. Above are two links that lead to the wishlist and menu. The website has active text that changes at intervals and 3 slideshows that lead to websites with a detailed description of the characteristics. All boats can be added and removed from the wishlist. At the bottom of the website are links that lead to pages on social networks.
